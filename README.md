# Tech Community Calendar
The Tech Community Calendar is THE place to check for upcoming events in the tech community and lists conferences, hackathons and meetups happening around the world and when live will exist at www.TechCommunityCalendar.com.

Eventually we want the site to be managed by the tech community itself so that it is ran *by* the community, *for* the commmunity.
